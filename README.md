cplusplusprojects
=================

A sample of the C++ oriented work I've completed throught my years at DeVry University. 
In this folder you'll find just the .cpp and .h files to my code.
Most of these codes are original works done completely from scratch, with some exceptions. 
Some of the code has been re-used in other projects and were modified from templates. 

An example would be the DirectX programs, where the DirectXFramework.h/.cpp files and 
OpenGL header and source files. These were basic templates, but over time I modified them
to suit the needs of the programs I was creating, along with some playful experimintation. 
The templates merely offered me a "window" to show and display, and a basic Windows Message loop to utilize. 
All other aspects were written out as course work for the class, where we later built upon each aspect, 
and over time created a game or demo project specializing in specific features. 

Note: The use of .txt files for the Pong game were uploaded as the original .cpp and .h files were lost. 
I had the code uploaded on my Dropbox account long ago, so to upload the code as 
.txt file here.
